# Unit 1 Summative Task

###### ICS3UC - Mr. J :panda_face:üê†


You will code a simple guessing game. 

- Your code will go in [main.js](main.js), _after_ line 17
- Fill-in the "Author" in the comment header 
- There is already some code, don't change it.

### Part 1 - The User's Name
 
- Ask the user for their first name.
- Then ask the user for their last name.
    - Get the first letter of their first name
    - Get the first letter of their last name
    - Get the last letter of their last name
    - Output to the console: "I will call you F to the L-X"<br>Where `F` and `L-X` are those letters.<br>**For example**, if the user enters "Mr. Squirrel" you would output "I will call you M to the S-L". Or if the user enters "Khaby Lame" you would output "I will call you K to the L-E".

### Part 2 - The Game

- The code already contains a variable called `hidden_number`. This is a random number from 1 to 50.

- Tell the user that you are thinking of a number from 1 to 50 and ask them for a guess.
    - If they guess it correctly, congratulate them. The game ends.
    - Otherwise, tell them if their guess was too high or too low
  
- Ask them for a second guess.
    - If they guessed it correctly, congratulate them. The game ends.
    - Otherwise, tell them if their guess was too high or too low **and** if the hidden number is even or odd.

- Ask them for a third and final guess.
    - If they guess it correctly, congratulate them.
    - If they guess it wrong, tell them what the hidden number was.
    - The game ends.

When you have finished (or the deadline is met), upload your code to GitHub using the Source Control menu in VSCode, or use GitHub Desktop. Ask Mr. J üê† if you need help with this.
